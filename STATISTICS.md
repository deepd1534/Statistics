# STATISTICS

## Descriptive Statistics

### Definiton

- It consists of organizing and summarizing the data.
- Descriptive statistics, describes the properties of sample and population data.

### Population & Sample

- Population

	- A population is the entire group that you want to draw conclusions about.

- Sample

	- Defintion

		- A sample is the specific group that you will collect data from. The size of the sample is always less than the total size of the population.

	- Techniques

		- Simple Random Sampling

			- Defintion

				- Randomly select a subset of participants from the population, every member of the population has an equal chance of being selected.

			- Example

				- The names of 25 employees being chosen out of a hat from a company of 250 employees

		- Stratified Sampling

			- Defintion

				- Stratified random sampling is a method of sampling that involves the division of a population into smaller subgroups known as strata.

			- Example

				- Let’s consider a situation where a research team is seeking opinions about religion amongst various age groups. Instead of collecting feedback from 326,044,985 citizens, random samples of around 10000 can be selected for research. These 10000 citizens can be divided into strata according to age,i.e, groups of 18-29, 30-39, 40-49, 50-59, and 60 and above. Each stratum will have distinct members and number of members.
				- 

		- Systematic Sampling

			- Defintion

				- Systematic sampling is a type of probability sampling method in which sample members from a larger population are selected according to a random starting point but with a fixed, periodic interval. This interval, called the sampling interval, is calculated by dividing the population size by the desired sample size.

			- Example

				- As a hypothetical example of systematic sampling, assume that in a population of 10,000 people, a statistician selects every 100th person for sampling. 

		- Convenience Sampling

			- Defintion

				- A convenience sample is a type of non-probability sampling method where the sample is taken from a group of people easy to contact or to reach.

			- Think about how many ways you create the dataset
			- Example

				- Some examples of convenience sampling could include recruiting friends to participate in your study, collecting data from locations that are nearby, sending a survey in the mail, or sharing a link on social media.

					- Convenience sampling

- Example

	- Exit Poll - Elections

### Variables

### Distributions

- Defintion

	- A distribution is simply a collection of data, or scores, on a variable. Usually, these scores are arranged in order from smallest to largest and then they can be presented graphically.

- Gaussian/Normal Distribution

	- The Normal Distribution, also called the Gaussian Distribution, is the most significant continuous probability distribution. Sometimes it is also called a bell curve. A large number of random variables are either nearly or exactly represented by the normal distribution, in every physical science and economics. Furthermore, it can be used to approximate other probability distributions, therefore supporting the usage of the word ‘normal ‘as in about the one, mostly used.

		- Statistics (and in probability theory), the Normal Distribution, also called the Gaussian Distribution, is the most important continuous probability distribution. Sometimes it is also called a bell curve.

	- Empirical Rule (68-95-99.7% Rule)
	- Examples - IQ, Heights, Student Average
	- Z - Score

		- It will help you find out, how much standard deviation away a value is from the mean.

			- 

		- Example

	- Standard Normal Distribution

		- Defintion

			- A Normal distribution where the mean is 0 and standard deviation is 1

		- Practical Use case

			- Standardization - Applying Z scores

## Science of collecting, organizing and analyzing data for better decision making.

### Data

- Facts or pieces of data that can be measured.
- Ex : IQ of students of a class {98,97,16,67,89}

## Inferential Statistics

### Defintion

- Technique where in we use the data that we have measured to form conclusions.

### Statistic & Parameter

- Statistic

	- A parameter is a number describing a whole population (e.g., population mean)

- Parameter

	- a statistic is a number describing a sample (e.g., sample mean).

- Notations

	- 

- Estimating Parameters from statistics

	- Using inferential statistics, you can estimate population parameters from sample statistics. To make unbiased estimates, your sample should ideally be representative of your population and/or randomly selected.
	- Types

		- Point Estimate

			- A point estimate is a single value estimate of a parameter based on a statistic. For instance, a sample mean is a point estimate of a population mean.
			- Example

				- Problem : In your study on support for the death penalty among US residents, you find that 61% of participants in your sample support the death penalty. To estimate the population parameter, you calculate a point estimate and an interval estimate from your sample statistic.
				- Your point estimate is your sample statistic – you estimate that 61% of all US residents support the death penalty.

		- Interval Estimate

			- Problem : An interval estimate gives you a range of values where the parameter is expected to lie. A confidence interval is the most common type of interval estimate.
			- Example

				- To find the interval estimate, you construct a 95% confidence interval that tells you where the population parameter is expected to lie most of the time. With random sampling, there is a 0.95 probability that the true population parameter for support for the death penalty among US residents lies between 57% and 65%.

### Hypothesis Testing

- Hypothesis testing in statistics is a way for you to test the results of a survey or experiment to see if you have meaningful results. You’re basically testing whether your results are valid by figuring out the odds that your results have happened by chance. If your results may have happened by chance, the experiment won’t be repeatable and so has little use.
- Steps

	- Figure out your null hypothesis,
	- State your null hypothesis,
	- Choose what kind of test you need to perform,
	- Either support or reject the null hypothesis.

- Example

	- 

- Example 2

	- Let's say you are tossing a coin, you have tossed the coin 50 times and found that Heads came up 30 times. Can you say that the coin is fair?
	- To define, whether or not the coin is fair, it is always said that our result should be nearer to mean value. But how far? For that we use a important property - Significance Value given by alpha

### Estimation

- Standard Error

	- The standard error of the mean, or simply standard error, indicates how different the population mean is likely to be from a sample mean. 

### Confidence Intervals & Significance Values

- What does significance value mean? Let's say for the above problem, the significance value is 0.05, The confidence level is equivalent to 1 – the alpha level. So, if your significance level is 0.05, the corresponding confidence level is 95%.
- From Normal Distribution, the empirical rule, it is known where 95% of the data lies, if our result lies in this region. Then we can say that the coin is fair.
- Let's say we get 10 heads, if it falls outside our confidence interval region (confidence is determined by a domain expert), we can say that the coin is unfair, Thus we reject the null hypothesis.

### Type 1 and Type 2 Errors

- After the hypothesis testing is done, there can be the following outcomes. Either Null hypothesis is true or null hypothesis is false.

	- 1. We reject the null hypothesis , when in reality it is false.
	- 2. We reject the null hypothesis, when in reality it is true.

		- Type I error (false positive): the test result says you have coronavirus, but you actually don’t or a person is awarded a death sentence even though he is innocent.

	- 3. We accept the null hypothesis, when in reality it is true.
	- 4. We accept the null hypothesis when in reality it is false.

		- Type II error (false negative): the test result says you don’t have coronavirus, but you actually do. (or) We don't give him a death sentence even though he is guilty.

- Confusion Matrix

	- 

### One Tailed & Two Tailed Tests

- One- tailed test

	- Definiton

		- A one-tailed test is a statistical hypothesis test set up to show that the sample mean would be higher or lower than the population mean, but not both.

	- Example

		- Eg : Colleges in Karnataka have 85% placement rate, a new college was recently opened and it was found that a sample of 150 students had a placement rate of 88% with a standard deviation of 4%. Does this college has a placement rate greater than 85%
		- The above example becomes a one-tailed test. As it is only focused towards finding only on one side.
		- 

- Two - tailed test

	- Defintion

		- A two-tailed test, in statistics, is a method in which the critical area of a distribution is two-sided and tests whether a sample is greater than or less than a certain range of values.

	- Example

		- Eg : Colleges in Karnataka have 85% placement rate, a new college was recently opened and it was found that a sample of 150 students had a placement rate of 88% with a standard deviation of 4%. Does this college has a different placement rate than the other colleges ?
		- The above example becomes a two-tailed test. Let's assume the significance level as 0.05. Try creating a graph with confidence level mentioned. The value can be greater than 85 % or less than 85%, Now it becomes a two tailed test.
		- 

### Confidence Intervals

- Point Estimate

	- The value of any statistic that estimates the value of a parameter.

- Interval Estimate

	- It is generally, given by Point Estimate +- Margin or Error

- Example

	- Problem :On the quants test of CAT exam, the population standard deviation is known to be 100, A sample of 25 test takers have a mean of 520 score. Construct a 95% Confidence interval about the mean,
	- 
	- We are required to find out the range
	- Case I : Population standard deviation is given

		- Z test

			- Defintion

				- A z test is conducted on a population that follows a normal distribution with independent data points and has a sample size that is greater than or equal to 30.

		- Formula

			- 

		- Solution

			- 
			- 
			- Check, 0.975 on the Z- table

				- Interview question

	- Case II : Sample standard deviation is given

		- Problem :On the quants test of CAT exam, A sample of 25 test takers have a mean of 520 score with a standard deviation of 80. Construct a 95% Confidence interval about the mean,
		- 
		- t - test

			- Formula

				- 

			- To calculate the t value, degree of freedom needs to be calculated which is n-1 = 25-1 = 24
			- Look up the t-table and find the the corresponding value
			- Upper Bound
			- Solution

### One sample z- test

- Definition

	- The one-sample z-test is used to test whether the mean of a population is greater than, less than, or not equal to a specific value.

- Condition

	- 1. Population standard deviation is given 2. Sample size >= 30

- Example

	- In the population, the average IQ is 100 with a standard deviation of 15. Researchers want to test a new medication to see if there is positive or negative effect on intelligence or no effect at all. A sample of 30 participants who have taken the medication has a mean IQ of 140. Did the medication improve the Intelligence.

- Solution - Hypothesis testing

	- 
	- 
	- 
	- 
	- Therefore, the medication has improved the intelligence because the result is greater than 1.96

- A bank wants to open an ATM machine in a specific area - Interview question

### One sample t- test

- Condition : Population standard deviation is unknown.
- Example

	- 
	- 
	- Obtained from the t-table
	- 10.96>2.045 Thus, we reject the null hypothesis, the intelligence has increased and we reject the null hypothesis.

### 

- Defintion

	- A chi-square test is a statistical test used to compare observed results with expected results. The purpose of this test is to determine if a difference between observed data and expected data is due to chance, or if it is due to a relationship between the variables you are studying.
	- It is a non parametric test performed on categorical variables(nominal or ordinal) data

- Example

	- In the 2000 Indian census, the ages of the individual in a small town were found to be the following, Considering this again In 2010, ages of 500 individuals were sampled. Below are the results.
	- Using alpha = 0.05 , would you conclude that the population distribution of ages has changed in the test in the last 10 years?
	- Solution

		- 
		- 
		- Obtained from chi squared table
		- 

### p -value

- The p-value, or probability value, tells you how likely it is that your data could have occurred under the null hypothesis.
- P-values are usually automatically calculated by your statistical program 
-  The p-value can only tell you whether or not the null hypothesis is supported. It cannot tell you whether your alternative hypothesis is true, or why.
- If p value is not less than(greater) significance level, then we reject the null hypothesis. If p value is less than signifcance value we accept the null hypothesis.
- If p value is greater than significance value, you fall in the tail region -> we reject the null hypothesis. If p value is less than the significance value then you fall in the confidence region -> We accept the null hypothesis

### Correlation & Covariance

- Spearman captures non- linear properties as well.
